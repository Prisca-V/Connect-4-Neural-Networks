          The dataset is generated by having two agents play Connect Four against each other using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To increase diversity, each game may begin with a few random opening moves. These random moves are not included in the dataset , only positions that result from MCTS decisions are stored.

        content: After the opening phase, MCTS selects moves based on a configurable search depth that controls how strong the agent plays. At each valid turn, the current board is encoded from the perspective of the player to move using a 6×7×2 tensor. The first channel represents the current player’s discs, and the second channel represents the opponent’s discs. This canonical encoding removes the need for a separate turn indicator and allows a single model to learn both players’ strategies.

          To avoid storing duplicate positions, each board state is converted into a byte hash and used as a key in a lookup table. Instead of saving repeated boards multiple times, the system aggregates them. For each unique state, a 7-element count vector records how often MCTS selects each column. The final label can be assigned using a majority vote, and positions with low agreement can optionally be filtered out.
          The generator also supports horizontal symmetry augmentation by mirroring board states and corresponding column labels. Checkpoints are saved periodically so generation can resume if interrupted. After all games are completed, the aggregated states are converted into feature tensors and label arrays, resulting in a deduplicated and policy-consistent dataset suitable for supervised training.

This is particularly useful for Connect 4, where the importance of a position depends heavily on context.
