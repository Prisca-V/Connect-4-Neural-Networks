          The dataset is generated by having two agents play Connect Four against each other using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To increase diversity, each game may begin with a few random opening moves. These random moves are not included in the dataset , only positions that result from MCTS decisions are stored.

        content: After the opening phase, MCTS selects moves based on a configurable search depth that controls how strong the agent plays. At each valid turn, the current board is encoded from the perspective of the player to move using a 6×7×2 tensor. The first channel represents the current player’s discs, and the second channel represents the opponent’s discs. This canonical encoding removes the need for a separate turn indicator and allows a single model to learn both players’ strategies.

          To avoid storing duplicate positions, each board state is converted into a byte hash and used as a key in a lookup table. Instead of saving repeated boards multiple times, the system aggregates them. For each unique state, a 7-element count vector records how often MCTS selects each column. The final label can be assigned using a majority vote, and positions with low agreement can optionally be filtered out.
          The generator also supports horizontal symmetry augmentation by mirroring board states and corresponding column labels. Checkpoints are saved periodically so generation can resume if interrupted. After all games are completed, the aggregated states are converted into feature tensors and label arrays, resulting in a deduplicated and policy-consistent dataset suitable for supervised training.

This is particularly useful for Connect 4, where the importance of a position depends heavily on context.

          The dataset consisted of positions generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search. In total, there were 131,980 board positions, with 105,584 samples used for training and 26,396 reserved for validation, following an eighty twenty split. Each sample was labeled with the best move, represented as a column from zero through six, determined by Monte Carlo Tree Search visit counts. The dataset was loaded and preprocessed by decoding each board position from its binary representation into the 6 by 7 by 2 format. Each board was then converted into nine patches, where each patch represents a flattened 3 by 3 by 2 region containing 18 values. The data was randomly shuffled before being divided into training and validation sets. Training was performed using batches of 128 samples, resulting in 825 training batches and 207 validation batches per epoch.
          Training was implemented using PyTorch after switching from TensorFlow to ensure compatibility with AWS deployment. A batch size of 128 was used. Optimization was performed using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001. Early stopping was applied with a patience of five epochs while monitoring validation loss to prevent overfitting and to stop training once performance stopped improving.
